Writing Modular Programs

Function prototypes in header files & Definition in C files

keep the prototypes of the related functions defined by you in a .h file 

Write the definitions of those functions in a .c file 

Compile the .c file to create the object file using the following command at UNIX prompt 
         cc -c fun1.o fun1.c

Write the main program and simply call the functions as per your requirement

Include the corresponding header files

Finally compile the main program at UNIX prompt as follows:
	cc -o fun1.o final.c

Write a makefile!
